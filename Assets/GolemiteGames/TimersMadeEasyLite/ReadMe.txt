Thankyou for purchasing TimersMadeEasyLite.

Make sure you are working within the canvas if you are displaying a visual timer.
A Demo scene is included in the scenes folder to demonstrate most of the functionality. 

To quickly get started -

1. There are three main ways to apply the timer:

	The first is to simply add the timer.cs script as a component on a text, textmeshpro, slider, or a radial image set to 'Filled'. 

	The second is to have a main Timer control object with the script applied to that object. You can then open up display and then output type and select the desired output type which are the same options as above. 

	The third is simply using the prefabs in the prefabs folder which have been automatically set up to run on start with 2 seconds of time. 

2. Simply set the desired time you want under Set time. This will calculate the total seconds for you. A maximum of 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds is available in the free version. 

3. Check start at runtime under customise to begin the timer on play. If you want to set it to start at a custom time, simply call the 'Timer' class method StartTimer(). This will use the time you have set in the inspector. 

4. There are a few customisation options to choose from, most are self explanatary so just feel free to have a play around with them or view the full documenation included in this package.
